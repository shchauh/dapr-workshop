# Building cloud native appplications with Distributed Application Runtime(Dapr)
A workshop for getting started with building microservices application with Distributed Application Runtime(Dapr)

## Introduction

Cloud has changed the way we develop our applications. Cloud provides benefits like - agility, availability, scalability, resiliency and many more. To make most out of these benefits, we need to choose correct architecture and processes for developing our applications. We need to develop applications in "Cloud Native" way.

Cloud native applications uses containers, APIs, microservices architecture and devops. Microservices architecture has lot of advantages as compared to traditional layered architecture also known as monolith architecture. 

 "Microservices applications are composed of small, independent services that communicate with each other using well-defined APIs"
 
 But developing microservices application is quite hard. Some challanges -
 
 * You need to design your application as set of independent services. Each of these service should model around the business domain.
 * You need to choose right technology stack for each service.
 * 
 *
 *
 
Each microservices application has some common set of challanges -
* Service to service invocation
* State management
* Secret managment
* Distrubuted tracing
