Source code for the hands-on labs in this workshop can be found in the existing [Dapr samples github repository](https://github.com/dapr/samples) . We need to clone this repository to our local system.

Open command prompt and navigate to a directory/create a directory where you want to keep the code. Then clone the GitHub dapr samples repository with following command

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dapr/samples.git

```
> You need Git installed on your system. Check prerquisites article for [installing git](https://github.com/shchauh/dapr-workshop/blob/master/prerequisites.md#git)

Once you have successfully cloned the sample repository, open it with visual studio code and do the hands-on labs. Once you open it in visual studio code, you will get two prompts from C# extension

- "There are unresolved dependencies. Please execute the restore command to continue" - Click "Restore"
- "Required assets to build and debug are missing from 'samples'. Add them? "- Click "Yes"
