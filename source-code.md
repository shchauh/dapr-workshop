Source code for the hands-on labs in this workshop can be found in the existing [Dapr samples github repository](https://github.com/dapr/samples) . We need to clone this repository to our local system.

Open command prompt and navigate to a directory/create a directory where you want to keep the code. Then clone the GitHub dapr samples repository with following command

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dapr/samples.git

```
